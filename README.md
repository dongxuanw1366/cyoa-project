# Choose Your Own Adventure

## Description
The purpose of creating this repository was to practice linking files and collaboration. In this project you will be able to feel very lucky. We wanted to let people know that good things might happen to you anywhere. You can win a lottery at home, or earn money from being greedy or nice. You might make friends with rich people and not even realize until it's your birthday!
